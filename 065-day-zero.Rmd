# Day Zero {#day0}

Some unconfs, such as the OzUnconf and the Uncoast Unconf, hosted "day zero" events to prepare participants for the collaboration and development that will occur on days one and two. 

All of the materials for the Uncoast Unconf Day Zero are available on [Github](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/uu-2019-day-zero). These materials cover the following topics: 

1. Collaboration with Git & Github in R
2. R Project Workflows
3. Creating R packages 
4. The Magic Tricks of HTML/CSS/JS
