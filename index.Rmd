# Preface {-}

```{block, type = "rmdcaution"}
This guide is a work in progress! We're very glad you're here but please proceed with caution. If you would like to contribute to this project, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/unconf-toolbox/unconf-guide). 
```

This guide came to be at the [Chicago R Unconference](https://chirunconf.github.io/), March 9-10, 2019. Many of the principles can be applied to any type of unconf, but our experience has been in attending [rOpenSci]() unconferences and in hosting our own unconferences, the [Chicago R Unconference](https://chirunconf.github.io/) and the [Uncoast Unconference](http://uuconf.rbind.io/). These unconfs have been focused on developing tools for R, but you can substitute your favorite open source computing language as you wish.

<!--Hi, Sam here. Just writing an outline for now.

### Outline {-}

1. What is an unconf and why should you organize one? 
2. What **physical** infrastructure do you need to host an unconference?
3. What **online** infrastructure do you need to host an unconference? 
4. `r emo::ji("music")` Money money money money. MON-AY `r emo::ji("music")`
5. Applications: what questions to ask, how to evalues them, and what tools to use
6. Taking care of people: pre-unconf chats, food, logding, travel, space accomodations
7. Day One: intros/icebreakers, projects, space utilization, issue tracking
8. Day Two: continuing/switching projects, "finishing" projects, reporting out
9. After the unconf
