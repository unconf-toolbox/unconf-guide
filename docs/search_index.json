We‚Äôre very glad you‚Äôre here but please proceed with caution. If you would like to contribute to this project, please submit a pull request. This guide came to be at the Chicago R Unconference, March 9-10, 2019. Many of the principles can be applied to any type of unconf, but our experience has been in attending rOpenSci unconferences and in hosting our own unconferences, the Chicago R Unconference and the Uncoast Unconference. These unconfs have been focused on developing tools for R, but you can substitute your favorite open source computing language as you wish. "],

Why should you organize an unconf?", " 1 What is an ‚ÄúUnconf‚Äù and why should YOU organize one? What is an ‚Äúunconference‚Äù? An unconference is a very well-named event. The unconf takes the traditional highly structured conference format and turns it on its head. There are no expensive registration fees, formal abstract submissions, or time-limited talks. To quote one organizer of a large unconferece, ‚ÄúWe invite a couple of hundred really interesting people for an event without a program, which emphasizes interaction between the participants rather than on prepared presentations‚Äù (O‚ÄôReilly 2018). According to O‚ÄôReilly (2018) and Andrea Wulf, the first ‚Äúunconference‚Äù was held back in 1828 in Germany. It was put on by Alexander von Humboldt, the Prussian Polymath. For this 19th century event, ‚Äúhe invited hundreds of scientists [‚Ä¶] to attend a conference in Berlin. Unlike previous such meetings at which scientists had endlessly presented papers about their own work, Humboldt put together a very different programme. Rather than being talked at, he wanted the scientists to talk with each other. There were convivial meals and social outings [‚Ä¶]. Meetings were held among botanical, zoological and fossil collections as well as at the university and the botanical garden. Humboldt encouraged scientists to gather in small groups and across disciplines. He connected the visiting scientists on a more personal level, ensuring that they forged friendships that would foster close networks. He envisaged an interdisciplinary [coalition] of scientists who would exchange and share knowledge.‚Äù This old idea is new again in the 21st century tech industry. Large unconferences attract web developers, data scientists, and other tech-minded folks every. They often are similar to ‚Äúhackathons‚Äù where developers and designers come together to create a functioning software product during a short period of time, usually only a few days. What is the history of the R unconf? The mother of the Chicago R Unconference and the Uncoast Unconference is the rOpenSci unconference, or #runconf. It began in 2014, and has been held every year since. It has also spurred the OzUnconf event in Australia, first held in 2016. At these events, attendees create new R packages, make Shiny Apps, write documentation (like this book!), and contribute to existing packages.

["physical.html", "2 Physical Infrastructure", " 2 Physical Infrastructure First things first, you need a space. The space should be the first thing you acquire, because without a space, you cannot have an unconf. This should be a space large enough for your conference, typically 30-50 people. There should be working space for all participants: chairs, table surface, whiteboard &amp; dry erase markers, paper &amp; pen. The location should also have strong WiFi that everyone can access. See Chapter 6 for more details about what your space should have. Some ideas for spaces are: Large meeting rooms or classrooms at academic institutions Co-working spaces Meeting rooms that your employer can rent out or loan you for two to three days Ideally, the space should be within walking distance of one or more hotels so that your participants can easily go to and fro. If your location is not near lodging, rent a van that can shuttle participant from the hotel to the venue, or consider asking participants to carpool between the venue and the hotel(s). You should have the space secured at least 4-6 months ahead of time. Date considerations: Weekends are optimal for people whose jobs wouldn‚Äôt allow for them to attend this type of event during the week. Weekends also require people giving up their weekend, so consider that. Weekdays require people to take time off of work, but they may be able to get their employer to fund their travel and lodging. Avoid major religious holidays. Consult the interfaith calendar. If you are hosting in the US or Canada on a weekend, avoid daylight savings time so that people aren‚Äôt losing an hour of sleep! üò¥ When you check out the space, make sure that you know where the dumpsters are. You‚Äôll need to take out the trash! ‚ôªÔ∏è "],
["online.html", "3 Online Infrastructure Github Organization Website Twitter", " 3 Online Infrastructure ‚ÄúI think web therefore I am.‚Äù Github Organization Create a Github Organization for your unconf. The organization can host the repo for your website, a place to post project ideas before the event, a Wiki, and a repo for every project that is started at your unconf. During your conference, you can use the issues explorer from the Unconf Toolbox for your participants to easily explore possible projects and see when projects are closed. Website Having a websitve for your conference is the most important piece of your online infrastructure. It legitimizes your event, hosts your branding, and shows potential sponsors that you‚Äôre serious and their money will be put to good use. In the Unconf Toolbox, we have a website skeleton that is under an open source license that you are welcome to use as an example. (You must include the license with it.) You can also branch out on your own and try out blogdown. This is what I (ST) did for the Uncoast Unconf website, but this is one of those ‚Äúdo as I say, not as I do‚Äù moments, so proceed with caution! Twitter To create a Twitter account, you‚Äôll also need an email account. Consider creating a Gmail account specifically for the event. With this email account you can also send out mailings to your applicants and participants. Check out the communication repository in the Unconf Toolbox. You should also create a conference hashtag so that unconf attendees can easily share their work. Twitter account Twitter hashtag "],

Reach out to current and past employers, ask professors if they know of programs at their university that can assist you, and contact local data science companies.

["apps.html", "5 All Things Applications", " 5 All Things Applications The unconfs we‚Äôve put on have been ‚Äúinvitation-only.‚Äù This sounds a lot more highbrow than it actually is. There is an application process, and you can tailor the questions to your own event. The Unconf Toolbox has a Shiny app, powered by Dropbox, to host the application form for your unconf. Some of the application questions are: What is your occupation? What field(s) are you applying R to? What do you hope to accomplish and/or learn at this unconf? You‚Äôll want to tailor the questions to your specific unconf. Some things to consider: How much R experience are you looking for? Can beginners enjoy your unconf, too? How much other experience are you looking for? Are you in a specific application field? e.g. education, bioinformatics, etc. Bottom line, it‚Äôs all about the bottom line. An unconf shouldn‚Äôt have a registration fee by definition, so an application is a necessary piece to keep costs controlled. Hopefully, the Unconf Toolbox can provide others with the framework for hosting an unconf so everyone who wants to will get the chance to attend one soon in their area! "],

A sample code of conduct is posted in the Unconf Toolbox here. Space: Gender neutral bathrooms Quiet room for meditation, prayer, etc. Nursing moms room Wheelchair accesibility Food: Ask people their dietary needs once you know they‚Äôre coming to the conference. Consider: Religious considerations (Kosher, Halal) Vegan, Vegetarian Others: gluten intolerance (Celiac), lactose intolerance, etc. Check with the venue about what food is allowed. Some places will only allow one company or set of companies Lodging: Reserve hotel block 6-8 weeks ahead of the conference Ask people if they are willing to share rooms with other attendees to save money "],
