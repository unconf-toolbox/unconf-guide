We‚Äôre very glad you‚Äôre here but please proceed with caution. If you would like to contribute to this project, please submit a pull request. This guide came to be at the Chicago R Unconference, March 9-10, 2019. Many of the principles can be applied to any type of unconf, but our experience has been in attending rOpenSci unconferences and in hosting our own unconferences, the Chicago R Unconference and the Uncoast Unconference. These unconfs have been focused on developing tools for R, but you can substitute your favorite open source computing language as you wish. "],

Why should you organize an unconf?", " 1 What is an ‚ÄúUnconf‚Äù and why should YOU organize one? What is an ‚Äúunconference‚Äù? An unconference is a very well-named event. The unconf takes the traditional highly structured conference format and turns it on its head. There are no expensive registration fees, formal abstract submissions, or time-limited talks. To quote one organizer of a large unconferece, ‚ÄúWe invite a couple of hundred really interesting people for an event without a program, which emphasizes interaction between the participants rather than on prepared presentations‚Äù (O‚ÄôReilly 2018). According to O‚ÄôReilly (2018) and Andrea Wulf, the first ‚Äúunconference‚Äù was held back in 1828 in Germany. It was put on by Alexander von Humboldt, the Prussian Polymath. For this 19th century event, ‚Äúhe invited hundreds of scientists [‚Ä¶] to attend a conference in Berlin. Unlike previous such meetings at which scientists had endlessly presented papers about their own work, Humboldt put together a very different programme. Rather than being talked at, he wanted the scientists to talk with each other. There were convivial meals and social outings [‚Ä¶]. Meetings were held among botanical, zoological and fossil collections as well as at the university and the botanical garden. Humboldt encouraged scientists to gather in small groups and across disciplines. He connected the visiting scientists on a more personal level, ensuring that they forged friendships that would foster close networks. He envisaged an interdisciplinary [coalition] of scientists who would exchange and share knowledge.‚Äù This old idea is new again in the 21st century tech industry. Large unconferences attract web developers, data scientists, and other tech-minded folks every. They often are similar to ‚Äúhackathons‚Äù where developers and designers come together to create a functioning software product during a short period of time, usually only a few days. What is the history of the R unconf? The mother of the Chicago R Unconference and the Uncoast Unconference is the rOpenSci unconference, or #runconf. It began in 2014, and has been held every year since. It has also spurred the OzUnconf event in Australia, first held in 2016. At these events, attendees create new R packages, make Shiny Apps, write documentation (like this book!), and contribute to existing packages.

["physical.html", "2 Physical Infrastructure", " 2 Physical Infrastructure First things first, you need a space. The space should be the first thing you acquire, because without a space, you cannot have an unconf. This should be a space large enough for your conference, typically 30-50 people. There should be working space for all participants: chairs, table surface, whiteboard &amp; dry erase markers, paper &amp; pen. The location should also have strong WiFi that everyone can access. See Chapter 6 for more details about what your space should have. Some ideas for spaces are: Large meeting rooms or classrooms at academic institutions Co-working spaces Meeting rooms that your employer can rent out or loan you for two to three days Ideally, the space should be within walking distance of one or more hotels so that your participants can easily go to and fro. If your location is not near lodging, rent a van that can shuttle participant from the hotel to the venue, or consider asking participants to carpool between the venue and the hotel(s). You should have the space secured at least 4-6 months ahead of time. Date considerations: Weekends are optimal for people whose jobs wouldn‚Äôt allow for them to attend this type of event during the week. Weekends also require people giving up their weekend, so consider that. Weekdays require people to take time off of work, but they may be able to get their employer to fund their travel and lodging. Avoid major religious holidays. Consult the interfaith calendar. If you are hosting in the US or Canada on a weekend, avoid daylight savings time so that people aren‚Äôt losing an hour of sleep! üò¥ When you check out the space, make sure that you know where the dumpsters are. You‚Äôll need to take out the trash! "],
